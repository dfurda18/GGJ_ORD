# Between Heaven and Hell
Repository for ORD's team in the GGJ 2022

This is an un submitted work for the Global Game Jam in 2022. The theme was **duality**. 

Participants:
Dario Urdapilleta: Lead Programmer, artist.
Daniel Ogunrinde: Level Designer
Marcelo Soares: Programmer
Olivia O: Music Composer

We created mechanics for a platformer where an ability can switch into parallel levels (Heaven and Hell). This was out first time working with Github and Unity together and we spent most of our time fixing issues with it.

the prototipe was unfinished and therefore not submitted.
